        <p class="patch">- Exremely Basic Enemy AI. Will certainly fix it next patch probably.</p>
        <p class="patch">- Screen Shake System implemented</p>
        <p class="patch">- Added a Font engine. Do not worry about the text. It will be fine lol</p>
        <p class="patch">- Added Commentary because I am bored, and need to test out the new font system. There is a lot of rare dialogue!</p>
        <p class="patch">- Greatly Reduced the Freeze Frame time</p>
        <p class="patch">- Enemies blink, and blinking now will not stack after death</p>
        <p class="patch">- Background retextured, and has a new rendering system</p>
        <p class="patch">- Healthbar improvements (increased contrast)</p>
        <p class="patch">- Enemies can now interact with each other (accidentally kill each other lol)</p>
        <p class="patch">- Exiting the game will have little effect</p>
        <p class="patch">- Weapons no longer collide with the walls and all that. It was too buggy, and not very fun to use</p>
