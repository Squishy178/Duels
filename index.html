        <p id = "test" class="patch">0.5 Patch Notes:</p>
        <p class="patch">- Removed Guard boosting (sorry?)</p>
        <p class="patch">- Improved the blinking system (was kind of weird before)</p>
        <p class="patch">- Player looks at the closest enemy, instead of the first enemy</p>
        <p class="patch">- Temporarily (or maybe permenantly) removed parrying</p>
        <p class="patch">- Slight weapon rebalancing</p>
        <p class="patch">- Better effects for when hurt</p>
        <p class="patch">- Fixed a large bug regarding the double weapons and jabbing</p>
        <p class="patch">- Added API for special weapons, so I can execute special functions when certain events happen (data driven)</p>
        <p class="patch">- Started work on a main menu.</p>
        <p class="patch">- Fixed Long Guarding</p>
        <p class="patch">- Optimized collision (now the lower damaging parts of weapons have less priority)</p>
        <p class="patch">- Collision much more accurate (more squares = more accuracy. integrals baby)</p>
        <p class="patch">- I wish I had something else cool to say lol.</p>
